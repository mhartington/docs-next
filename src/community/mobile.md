# Mobile Solutions for Vue.js

Vue has various solutions for targeting Native and Progressive Web Apps. Below are a few options available for developers.


- [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/solution/vue)

Capacitor is a project from the [Ionic Team](https://ionic.io) that allows developers to target native iOS, native Android, and PWAs all with the same codebase. They provide a single API that can be run across multiple platforms and allow you to use your existing app without having to change anything. Often paired with [Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com/docs), but can be used with any UI library.
